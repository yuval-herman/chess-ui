## Overview

This repository contains a small C chess UI that uses Raylib for graphics.

**Prerequisites**

- **Compiler(s):** A standards compliant c compiler.

**Build (using `nob`)**

1. Build the `nob` tool (if you don't already have the `nob` executable):

```sh
gcc -o nob nob.c
```

2. Run the build helper:

```sh
./nob
```

This will produce an executable named `main`.

**Backend**

- The project expects a backend executable, run it after starting the UI.
